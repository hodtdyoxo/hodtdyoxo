- I'm six feet tall
- I have a blue armchair
- There's a trunk in my room
- And I like almond-flavored chocolate
- I wake up feeling groggy
- Although I've never been in jail, I've come close
- I'm an Aries, with brown hair
- Somewhat stingy and I don't collect anything
- I keep my clothes organized
- I get bored on Christmas Eve
- If I sneeze, I don't make a sound
- And I don't talk with my mouth full
- I can say I have few friends
- But I don't know how many enemies I make
- My right eye is lazy
- They say I'm good, even though I'm not baptized
